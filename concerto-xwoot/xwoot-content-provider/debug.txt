In order to debug (i.e., view table contents and perform queries) you can use the 'ij' client provided with Apache Derby.

1) Go to the project directory and run the ij client.

2) Enter the following command in order to connect to the DB:
   driver 'org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver'; connect 'jdbc:derby:DB';
